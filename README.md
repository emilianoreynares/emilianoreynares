### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data science enthusiast passionate about knowledge representation and machine learning. With over ten years of experience as a manager and researcher in R&D&I projects, I've honed my skills in developing creative and practical solutions to real-world problems.

My blog about Knowledge Engineering, Ontologies, and FAIR Data reflects my dedication to combining theoretical rigor with practical application.

I have a unique perspective, having served as a scientific and technological advisor to public and private organizations, helping them achieve their goals through cutting-edge research and innovative ideas. By merging my passion for data science with a deep understanding of the organizations I work with, I can make a real difference in the world.

Join me on my journey to make data work for us, not the other way around.
