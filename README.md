As a PhD in Engineering with over a decade of hands-on experience, I’ve dedicated my career to driving innovation through data-driven solutions. My journey has taken me through both academia and industry, where I thrive on solving complex challenges at the intersection of technology and business. __I share my thoughts and ideas [here](https://github.com/emilianoreynares/emilianoreynares/wiki)__.

**Expertise:**
* I specialize in the development and governance of data models, ontologies, and knowledge graphs, seamlessly integrating them with cutting-edge AI/ML techniques.

**Current Endeavors:**
* I’m developing the offer and market of the [IQVIA Center for Health Data Semantics](https://www.iqvia.com/solutions/real-world-evidence/center-for-health-data-semantics).

**Past Adventures:**
* During my tenure as a Knowledge Engineer at [Boehringer Ingelheim](https://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/), I actively contributed to the development of a FAIR-enabled data platform. [Engaging](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/content/home.html) in pharmaceuticals/academia driven data FAIRification activities, I witnessed firsthand the power of standardized, accessible data.
* In a previous life, I donned the hats of a staff scientist at [CONICET](https://www.conicet.gov.ar/about-the-conicet/?lan=en) and a professor at [Universidad Tecnológica Nacional](https://utn.edu.ar/). These diverse experiences have shaped my holistic understanding of research, teaching, and practical application.
