### Hi, Iâ€™m Emiliano Reynares ğŸ‘‹

As aÂ PhD in EngineeringÂ withÂ over a decade of hands-on experience, Iâ€™ve dedicated my career toÂ driving innovation through data-driven solutions. My journey has taken me through both academia and industry, where I thrive onÂ solving complex challengesÂ at the intersection ofÂ technology and business.

**My Expertise:**
* I specialize in theÂ development and governance of data models, ontologies, and knowledge graphs, seamlessly integrating them withÂ cutting-edge AI/ML techniques.

**Current Endeavors:**
* Iâ€™mÂ crafting an ontology-based data quality strategy at [IQVIA](https://www.iqvia.com/).

**Past Adventures:**
* During my tenure as aÂ Knowledge Engineer at [Boehringer Ingelheim](https://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/), I actively contributed to the development of aÂ FAIR-enabled data platform. Engaging inÂ pharmaceuticals/academia driven data FAIRification activities, I witnessed firsthand the power of standardized, accessible data.
* In a previous life, I donned the hats of aÂ staff scientist at [CONICET](https://www.conicet.gov.ar/about-the-conicet/?lan=en)Â and aÂ professor at [Universidad TecnolÃ³gica Nacional](https://utn.edu.ar/). These diverse experiences have shaped my holistic understanding ofÂ research, teaching, and practical application.
